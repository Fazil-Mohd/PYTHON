"""Write a Python program using OOP concept for the below menu driven program. The 
created class should have three member functions occurrence (), frequency () , 
factors().Depending upon the choice, the corresponding member function must be 
called using the object of the class. From the main program user can select the menu 
option.(1. Occurrence of word 2. Character frequency 3. Factors 4. Exit). The loop 
should repeat until the choice is 4. 
Occurrence: Occurrence of each word in a sentence 
Character frequency: Count the frequency(occurrence) of characters in a word. 
Factors: Display the factors of a given number 
Exit: Exiting from the program """
